# Marriott Reparative Metadata Assessment Tool (MaRMAT) GUI

The MaRMAT GUI is a graphical application built using Tkinter in Python. This tool allows users to match terms from a problematic terms lexicon file with text data from a collections metadata file, facilitating metadata cleanup and analysis.

## Overview

The application provides the following functionalities:

- Load CSV files for both lexicon and metadata.
- Select specific columns from the metadata for analysis.
- Choose an identifier column in the metadata to relate back to the original dataset.
- Select categories of terms from the lexicon for searching.
- Perform matching to find terms in selected metadata columns and export results to a CSV file.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Utilizes Tkinter for a GUI interface.
- **File Loading**: Supports loading CSV files for lexicon and metadata.
- **Column Selection**: Allows users to choose specific columns from metadata for term analysis.
- **Identifier Selection**: Enables selection of an identifier column for linking matched terms back to the original metadata.
- **Category Selection**: Provides options to select categories of terms from the lexicon for matching.
- **Matching Process**: Performs regex-based term matching across selected metadata columns and chosen lexicon categories.
- **Output**: Exports matched data to a CSV file for further analysis or use.
